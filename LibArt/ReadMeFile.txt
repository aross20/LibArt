 For are website, we thought long and hard what we could do to make the website pop out more then a normal website could. So, we decided to go with a art website. That way we could show off great works of art that people would not normally get to show off because they don't have a way to. So we made LibArt, a website for our art classes in our school. We got the idea from the fact that we do not see much display of artwork within our school. 

					Color and Fonts
	We went with our school colors, which are maroon and gray. We decided on a marron background. We also put in a gray nav bar for the links to our other pages. For fonts, we used Google fonts to enhance the effect of our website.

					Summary
	We placed a display of of artwork on the home page, showing multiple visions of many students and their artwork. The second page is consitant of the gallery of artwork. The third page is entitled School Info, where anyone can find out anything about the school art programs. The About page is where anyone can find out why we made this page and our purpose for it. The fifth page is where any graduated high school artist can find an art college to pursue a new path. The next page is about the creators. The seventh page displays every piece of art that is uploaded to our website. Last is the contact page, where anyone can get in touch with us to post their masterpieces.
